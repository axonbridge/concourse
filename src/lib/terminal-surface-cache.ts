// A module-level cache that decouples an xterm surface's lifetime from the React
// component that displays it.
//
// THE PROBLEM IT SOLVES
// Switching sandboxes (or navigating away and back) unmounts the terminal panes.
// Historically each pane created its own `Terminal`, painted scrollback, and on
// unmount called `term.dispose()`. Coming back rebuilt the xterm from scratch and
// replayed the entire scrollback over the agent socket — the visible "reconnect
// and restore" lag. The underlying PTYs and agent WebSockets were never actually
// torn down (the sandbox registry keeps them all live), so the only thing being
// thrown away was the *view*.
//
// THE FIX
// A surface owns the `Terminal`, the DOM element it rendered into, and its live
// PTY output subscription. The React pane becomes a thin mount point that:
//   - on mount: re-parents the existing element into its container (instant — the
//     buffer is already painted, the subscription kept it current while away), or
//     creates a fresh surface the first time it sees an id;
//   - on unmount: PARKS the surface (moves its element to an offscreen holder)
//     instead of disposing it.
// The surface is destroyed — subscriptions torn down, `Terminal` disposed — only
// when the session/terminal is really closed (close / kill / delete), via the
// store teardown paths. See TerminalPane.tsx / UserTerminalPane.tsx for the wiring.
